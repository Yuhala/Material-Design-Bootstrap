# Material-Design-Bootstrap
This project provides a Simple Template to start any Material Design Bootstrap (MDB) Project.

**Note**: I made this simple template to help all those wishing to start MDB Projects but have problems with the code provided on the Official MDB Website. Please visit the [Official MDB Webiste](https://mdbootstrap.com) for documentation.

**How to use**: To start an MDB project with this template, simple clone the project into your local directory or download the zip file. Test your local project by opening the index.html file in your web browser. It should look like [this](https://mdbootstrap.com/live/_MDB/index/docs/skins/navy-blue-skin.html)

**Contributions**: This mini-project is open to contributions, feel free to signal errors with issues or directly correct the errors with pull-requests.

**Questions**: Feel free to ask any questions by adding issues or commenting sections.
